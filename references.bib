  abstract = 	 {Many recent successful (deep) reinforcement learning algorithms make use of regularization, generally based on entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence. We propose a general theory of regularized Markov Decision Processes that generalizes these approaches in two directions: we consider a larger class of regularizers, and we consider the general modified policy iteration approach, encompassing both policy iteration and value iteration. The core building blocks of this theory are a notion of regularized Bellman operator and the Legendre-Fenchel transform, a classical tool of convex optimization. This approach allows for error propagation analyses of general algorithmic schemes of which (possibly variants of) classical algorithms such as Trust Region Policy Optimization, Soft Q-learning, Stochastic Actor Critic or Dynamic Policy Programming are special cases. This also draws connections to proximal convex optimization, especially to Mirror Descent.}

abstract = {Building simulation software packages such as EnergyPlus are useful energy modeling tools. These software packages, however, are often not amenable to model-based control due to model complexity or difficulties connecting control algorithms with the software. We present a method for automatically generating input/output data from an EnergyPlus residential home model using the OpenStudio software suite. These input/output data are used to create a simple reduced-order model that can be evaluated in fractions of a second. The reduced-order model is implemented in a model predictive controller to minimize the home's electricity costs during summer months in Austin, Texas, USA. The controller optimally precools the home in the morning and turns down or off the air conditioning system in the afternoon. For this example, electricity prices were taken from actual market prices in the Austin area. The optimal precooling strategy given by the model predictive controller reduces peak energy consumption from the air conditioning unit by an average of 70% and reduces operating costs by 60%. Precooling, however, consumes more total energy versus not precooling. Reducing peak energy consumption by 1kWh results, on average, in an increase of 0.63kWh in overall energy consumption.}
