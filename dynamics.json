These data feed into Hydro‑Québec's SCADA systems, along with snow-course readings and rainfall estimates. From there, engineers build seasonal inflow models and update them daily.\n\nSynthetic years are then generated by sampling from these models. Each sampled inflow sequence is pushed through the deterministic mass balance, producing a possible reservoir trajectory. These Monte Carlo rollouts are used directly for planning. They help evaluate turbine schedules, size safety margins, and identify periods of elevated risk.\n\nStructured models are not just a matter of physical fidelity. They shape how data is used, how uncertainty is handled, and how downstream decisions are informed.
